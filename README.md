# My Neovim Config aka „Dotfiles”

This is my growing and constantly changing configuration directory for Neovim. The repository contains 
two branches with different setups.

**NOTE** This **requires** Neovim 0.11 or later.

Please refer to the [docs](doc/docs/index.md) for more information. There is also a [HTML
