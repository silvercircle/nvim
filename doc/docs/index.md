??? Note

      This documentation is WIP. It has only recently been started, so there is not much yet, but it's growing 
      almost every day.

## What exactly is this all about?
It's all about a [Neovim](https://neovim.io) configuration. You have probably heard the term **dotfiles** 
which usually describes a set of configuration files for one or more programs. The term **dotfiles** 
comes from a convention used by most UNIX-like operating systems: *Configuration files are often hidden 
and hidden files start with a dot in their filenames*. Hence the name dotfiles.

Neovim is no different. Its configuration is normally written in the Lua programming language and — on 
UNIX-like operating systems — resides under `$HOME/.config/nvim`

## [LSP setup](LSP/index.md)
This is probably the most important and most complex setup task. While a lot has been pre-configured you 
will likely still have to configure quite a few things.
