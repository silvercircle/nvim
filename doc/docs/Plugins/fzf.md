# Fzf-Lua Integration

This config uses [Fzf-Lua](https://github.com/ibhagwan/fzf-lua) for most of the more complex picker jobs 
like grep and most lsp tasks. The more recent [snacks picker](../snacks_picker.md) is used for some 
custom pickers and features that are not available in Fzf-Lua.

Most of the Fzf-Lua pickers are available from the [command palette](../commandpalette.md)

### Zoxide history viewer

++ctrl+x++ ++z++ opens your zoxide directory history. This requires a working installation of 
[Zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide) on your system.
