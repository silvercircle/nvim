# The Command Palette

The command palette is some sort of list that will allow you to select from a wide range of commands. 
Each command has a description, belongs to a category and has one or more keyboard shortcuts assigned.

Commands do not need to be mapped to keyboard shortcuts, which allows you to free keyboard mappings for 
more frequently used commands.

The command palette is always available via the keyboard shortcut ++alt+p++.

The command palette will be populated once the first file was loaded. Because of the large number of 
commands to process, it would add significant startup time, that's why activation is delayed.
