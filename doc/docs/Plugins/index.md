This Neovim configuration uses a large number of plugins. About 50 in total, but not all are always 
active or even loaded.

- [Fzf-Lua](fzf.md) - Used for the majority of `pickers` (file browsers, grep and live grep, 
     LSP queries and many more.

- [Oil](oil.md) - The famous Neovim file manager that allows you to work with files and 
     directories *The Vim Way*.

- [Snacks](snacks.md) - This is a collection of plugins covering a vast area of features and 
     areas. Only a few of them are currently in use by this config.
